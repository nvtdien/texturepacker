Minecraft Texture Maker
=======================

A crazy idea by Damian Cugley <http://www.alleged.org.uk/>

Minecraft is a game whose appearance can be customized with texture packs—collections of images wrapped up as a ZIP archive, This project is a set of tools for building texture packs, both assembling oreignal packs and remixing existing packs to tailor them to a user’s strange desires.

Development comes in three levels:

- a library that manipulates textures and can assemble composite packs from existing source packs;

- a recipe language that specifies how to build a pack, allowin g it to be updated automatically when its source packs are updated; and

- a web application that combines a texture pack gallery with an interface for building recipes.

Of these as of January 2011 I have made a start on the library and the recipe interpreter.
