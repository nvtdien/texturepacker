Minecraft Recipes
=================

This directory is for recipes and maps describing the default textures
embedded in Minecraft itself.

Basically this means that the `maps` directory has atlases for the
default texture pack. For now this is structured as a set of maps for
betas 1.2, 1.3, â€¦, with each atlas referring to its predecessor and just
adding the new tiles. This is useful when writing updater recipes.
